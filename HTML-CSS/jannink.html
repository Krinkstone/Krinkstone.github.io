        <h4>
            There was a boy a long, long time ago, in the same galaxy as now.<br>
            That boy was me, and oh boy, i can tell you that boy is gone.<br>
            <br>Anyways, im not here to tell you about the past...<br>
            im here to tell you whats to come.<br>   
            <br>I made this website to represent my work...(i am happy about*).<br>
            That work can vary alot, from games to graphic design.<br>
            Anything i want to share with the world will be on here.<br>
            <br>Well i probably should start with myself.<br>
            I am callled Šime Jannink, born and grew up as Dutch.<br>
            Born in december 2005 i have never experienced a hot birthday.<br>
            I describe myself as a average person, not mentally but physically.<br>
            Not too long, not short, neither fat and without anorexia.<br>
            <br>My hobbies are Coding, Programming and Writing online languages.<br>
            I do have other things i am in to, like Batminton and Gaming.<br>
            I am open for new ideas, just to explore new things.<br>
            Snowboarding was fun, broke my wrist on the first day,<br>
            but that doesn't stop me! -16th of March, 2022<br>
            <br>I am currently schooled at Metis Montessori Lyceum.<br>
            The school does really well in inspiring me, in some things.<br>
            Programming is very fun and they inspired me to start.<br>
            The school is very cool and i think its a good school.<br>
            <br>My mom is Croatian and My dad is as Dutch as you can be.<br>
            That the reason i speak Dutch, Croatian and English.<br>
            If i would have to give myself a nationality it would be Internet.<br>
