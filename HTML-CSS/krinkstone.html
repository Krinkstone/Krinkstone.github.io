        <h1>ONLINE REALITY</h1>
        <h4>
            Online i am know as Krinkstone, some call me Krink. <br>
            I like this name because there are endless possibilities of variations. <br>
            I will list every name i have gotten so far down below, cool... right?<br>
            <br>Online i am most active as a gamer.<br>
            I am into some very hard games like jump king and cuphead. <br>
            The fun of those games is that it takes a long time to reach a goal,<br>
            mentally that helps with setting goals in real life, and ofcourse, satisfaction.<br> 
            <br>Those are not the only games i play, take Apex Legends as a example.<br>
            Apex Legends is a first person, battle royale.<br>
            The reason i play that game is because you can hit satisfying shots, thats all.<br>
            Just the definition of CSGO.<br>
            <br>You see that anime face on your right side?<br>
            That character from Spirited away is my main character.<br>
            I was always facinated by the animations Studio Ghibly made,<br>
            the movies all give off such a good spirit and are beautifull.<br>
            My Neighbor Totoro is a really good one too! actually all of them are.<br>
            <br>My Steam account is called Krinkstone,<br>
            My discord ID is Krinkstone#1752,<br>
            On Twitter i am called @RealKrinkstone,<br>
            and that is far from being all my ID's, but idc.<br>
            If you have any questions please ask them,<br>
            I am the most active on Twitter and Discord and DM's are open.<br>
